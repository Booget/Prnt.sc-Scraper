<h1 align="center">Prnt.sc Scraper Tool</h1>

  ## üñ•Ô∏è About the tool
- ‚ö° This is a simple JavaScript tool that generates a random prnt.sc link and then it scrapes the link to get the .png image. This is actualy quite fun to see some of the stupid things people upload. I use this method on my site (https://reallycoolcat.tech/) within the tools section.
